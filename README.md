<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
      The field of IT jobs and technologies keeps evolving quickly, such fast development confuses students and they do not know which skills they need to learn for which job.
      </li>
      <li>
      Some of these confusions can lead to questions like:
        <li>Do I need to learn C++ to be a data scientist ?</li>
        <li>Do DevOps and System Admins use the same technologies ?</li>
      </li>
      <li>
      The aim of this project is to develop a data-driven solution for students to answer such questions.
      </li>
      <li>
      We want to understand the relationships between the jobs and the technologies.
      </li>
